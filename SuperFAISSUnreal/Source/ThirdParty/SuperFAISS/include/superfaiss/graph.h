// Bank Inspector — Tier 1 module M1: the mutual k-NN graph + connected components that
// back the Inspector's Structure view.
// Post-processing over exact query output; touches no kernel, quantization, or format.
//
// Determinism tier: PER-DEVICE. Fixed sample, fixed order, pinned ties (query tie-break
// is ascending index; union-find edge order is ascending (i, j); component ids
// canonicalize to the smallest member row index). Bit-identical on repeat calls on one
// device, given bit-identical query results. NO CrossDevice claim (the float score paths
// inherit the library's per-device tier exactly as pca.h discloses of itself).
//
// All functions validate their arguments and write no output on rejection (the dim-2
// trust-boundary contract): k < 1, k >= view count, count 0/1 where a k-th neighbor
// cannot exist, or a null buffer returns InvalidArgument with no partial write.

// For each row of the (sampled) view, its top-k neighbor row indices by the bank's own
// metric, via the existing batch query path; ties break ascending index. When
// excludeSelf is true the row itself is dropped from its own list. outNeighbors is
// count*k int32, row-major (outNeighbors[r*k + j] is row r's j-th nearest, best-first);
// a slot with no available neighbor is -1. `workspace` warm for k (self-exclusion widens
// the top-k heap by one internally). k in [1, count-1]; k < 1, k >= count, or a null
// buffer -> InvalidArgument, no output write.

// bytes alone. outGroupOf is count int32: outGroupOf[r] is the SMALLEST row index whose
// stored bytes (and scale) are identical to r's, or r itself when r is unique. `scratch`
// is caller-provided, count int32 (the hash-pass workspace). A null buffer or count < 1

// order-independent — never allocation-order artifacts. `duplicateGroups` is the
