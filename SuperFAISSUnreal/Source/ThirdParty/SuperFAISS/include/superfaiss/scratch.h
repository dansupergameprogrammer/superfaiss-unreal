// Scratch banks (V2 plan section 7): a fixed-capacity, append-friendly bank whose
// snapshot IS a BankView — every query path (V1 flat scan, V2 segmented scan)
// works on scratch content with zero new query code.
//
// Concurrency model — single writer, epoch reads:
//   - One logical writer at a time. Append/Remove/Grow/Save/Load are writer-side;
//     coordinating writers is the caller's job (a debug-build owner guard asserts it).
//   - Readers are lock-free and wait-free: Snapshot() acquires the published count
//     once; every row below it is immutable forever after (append-only arena), so
//     the view is stable without locks. Rows publish only via the count — a scan
//     never observes a partially-written row.
//   - Removal is snapshot-consistent, not mid-scan-preemptive: tombstones are
//     visible to snapshots taken after the Remove; a scan already in flight over an
//     older snapshot may still return the removed row. Deletion is exclusion — the
//     caller ORs the snapshot's tombstone words into the query's excludeBits.
//   - Grow and Load are EXCLUSIVE: no readers, no other writer. The core documents
//     the precondition; a host's pin mechanism is what enforces it in practice.
//
// Index stability is the consumer contract (T-044 W4): Grow preserves row indices —
// it copies rows and tombstones and never compacts; a saved index means the same row
// before and after. Freeze() renumbers (compaction drops tombstoned rows) and returns
// the old->new map so consumers remap stored handles as part of the freeze.

// Archive seam for scratch persistence. The caller owns the medium (file, save-game
// blob, network); the bank owns the format. Both callbacks return false on failure;
// only the direction in use need be non-null.
