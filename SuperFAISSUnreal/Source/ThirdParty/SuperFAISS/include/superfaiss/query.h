// float round-trip, no requantization. CrossDevice-only by construction:
// params.exactness must be CrossDevice, the bank must be Int8 with paddedDims <=
// kMaxCrossDeviceDims, and a Cosine bank rejects a zero self-dot query (ZeroNormQuery,
// the bank's own validation law). The payload validates at the boundary: the scale
// must be FINITE and non-negative, and the self-dot is recomputed from the image and
// must match — a desynced payload is InvalidArgument, never a repaired or silently
// wrong ranking. Composes with exclusion, ScoreAs, and both bias
// forms exactly as Query does in CrossDevice mode — the same kernels, the same
// epilogue, the same subnormal floor. Segments are not accepted on a pre-quantized
// query (InvalidArgument): segment validation is defined against the float query the
// caller does not have. Allocation-free once `workspace` is warm for this k.
