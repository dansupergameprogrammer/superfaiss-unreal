// Bank Inspector — Tier 1 module M2: the k-th-nearest-neighbour distance probe +
// baseline calibration + two-limb tri-state novelty verdict that backs the Inspector's
// Novelty view. Post-processing over exact query output; touches no kernel, quantization,
// or format.
//
// Determinism tier: PER-DEVICE (fixed sample, fixed order, integer rank over a sorted
// fixed baseline, ties pinned to the lowest rank). No CrossDevice claim. The float32
// whole-row/channel legs of NoveltyProbeDistance accumulate in DOUBLE (the epilogue
// convention every other reduction in this library uses — analytics.cpp's XdPairScore/
// XdChannelPairScore, HitDistance, the NN reductions), ending in the same subnormal floor
// as the int8 legs; this is pinned here so both the implementation and an independent
// oracle build against one arithmetic, not two that might silently diverge.
//
// The two-limb tri-state verdict is composed by the CALLER from these four functions (no
// separate "verdict" entry exists; graph.h's precedent — ConnectedComponents composes
// BuildKnnNeighbors + MutualFilter + BuildDuplicateGroups — is the same shape).

// The empirical-CDF rank of a probe distance within the baseline distribution: the
// fraction of `sortedBaseline` entries STRICTLY LESS THAN `distance` (ties resolve to
// the LOWEST rank), normalized to [0, 1]. `sortedBaseline` is ascending, `count` entries.
// count < 1 or a null buffer -> InvalidArgument, no write. This is limb 2's statistic; the
// verdict compares the result against lambda (>= lambda => novel, else familiar).

// The limb-1 exact-distance entry: the metric's OWN exact distance function between
// `paddedProbeQuery` and one stored row, dispatched per (metric, scope, quant) — the
// primitive both the implementation and an independent oracle build against and
// cross-check by execution (one verified number, not two hopefully-agreeing ones).
// `channel == -1` scores the whole row; `channel` in [0, bank.channelCount) scores that
// channel's sub-range only.
//
// Dispatch:
//   - int8, whole-row: the XdPairScore arithmetic (analytics.cpp) — int8 cross/self-dot
//     accumulation, one fixed-order double epilogue, the subnormal floor (XdFloor). Cosine:
//     `1 - cross/sqrt(aSq*bSq)`; L2: the expanded `||aScale*a - bScale*b||^2` form. Requires
//     a nonzero self-dot on both operands under Cosine — always true here, since a
//     whole-row-normalized bank rejects a zero-norm row at bake and the probe is a query
//     (rejected upstream of this call on a Cosine bank).
//   - float32, whole-row: the SAME two formulas, accumulated in DOUBLE over the plain
//     floats (see the header note above), ending in the same subnormal floor.
//     **Disclosed limit: this leg does NOT carry int8's "exact zero for any scalar
//     multiple" guarantee.** Int8 exactness rests on cross/aSq/bSq being EXACT INTEGER
//     sums — zero rounding until the one final division+sqrt, so parallel int8 codes give
//     a provably exact ratio. Float32 has no such step: even constructing a scaled probe
//     (`c * row`) is itself a rounded float32 multiplication, so the probe is not
//     bit-exactly parallel to the row before this function ever sees it — confirmed
//     executed (scale c in {0.1, 25, 1000} against a real Cosine bank: nonzero, scattered
//     residuals, not a threshold-shaped failure — genuine rounding noise, not a formula
//     defect). This entry still computes the honest distance; the guarantee that a
//     nonzero result is impossible for a TRUE duplicate holds only for BYTE-IDENTICAL
//     float32 probe/row (trivially exact there: cross == aSq == bSq). A caller reading
//     this as limb 1 gets a real, non-thresholded distance on every float32 input; it
//     just cannot assume every scalar-multiple duplicate reads exactly 0 the way every
//     int8 one does.
//   - channel (either quant): the sliced form. The probe is quantized (int8 leg, via the
//     same arithmetic QuantizeQueryXd uses) or read (float32 leg) over the WHOLE
//     bank.paddedDims once, then BOTH operands restrict every sum to
//     `[bank.channels[channel].offset, +length)`; the stored row keeps its own whole-row
//     int8 scale (channel scoring never renormalizes per channel — analytics.cpp's
//     XdChannelPairScore convention). **Cosine only, BOTH sides:** a zero-energy channel
//     slice on EITHER the probe or the stored row returns `Status::ZeroNormQuery`, no
//     write — a directionless slice is a Cosine duplicate of nothing, so it is never
//     silently floored to a false distance-0 match the way the shipped
//     `XdChannelPairScore` reduction floors it for its own (different) purpose. Channel L2
//     needs no such guard (a zero-energy slice scores a real positive distance).
//   - Dot: never dispatched — `bank.metric == Metric::Dot` is `InvalidArgument` (the
//     verdict-unavailable decision is made upstream of this call; this entry serves only
//     the verdict domain, L2 and Cosine).
//
// Rejections (InvalidArgument, no write): `bank.count < 1`; `storedRow` outside
// `[0, bank.count)`; `channel` outside `[-1, bank.channelCount)`, or `channel != -1` on a
// bank with no channel table; a null `paddedProbeQuery`/`outDistance`; `bank.metric ==
// Metric::Dot`; on an int8 bank, a channel whose `offset`/`length` is not a multiple of
// the int8 SIMD grid (`kAlignment / ElementSize(Int8)`) — never fires on a validated
// bank (`validate.cpp` grid-aligns every channel), closes the gap for a hand-built
// `BankView`.
// `workspace` stages the int8 leg's quantized probe (ReserveXdQuery/XdQ8/XdScale/XdSqSum)
// -- the same warm, tracked buffer KthNeighborDistance/CalibrateNoveltyBaseline reuse via
// their own `workspace` params, never a per-call heap allocation (this entry used to
// bypass the library's own AllocationCount() seam via a raw std::vector — fixed). The
// float32 leg does not touch `workspace` (no quantization to stage).

// pinned conversion, `RankDistance(metric, score)`: L2 -> `score` (already a squared
// distance); Cosine -> `1 - score` (bake-normalized rows, so the hit score is a
// similarity). Dot is EXCLUDED from the verdict domain (`-score` is monotone but not a
