# The Bank Format

A **bank** is an immutable set of embedding vectors prepared for scanning. This document
specifies both the interchange format (what pipelines produce) and the baked in-memory
layout (what the kernels scan). The format is versioned by `schemaVersion`; consumers
must hard-reject versions they do not know. Current version: **1**.

## 1. Interchange: the `.wvbank` sidecar pair

Two files, deliberately primitive so any pipeline can emit them in a few lines
(reference implementation: [`tools/wvbank.py`](../tools/wvbank.py)):

### `<name>.wvbank.json` — the header

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "dims": 100,
  "count": 40000,
  "metric": "cosine",
  "dtype": "float32",
  "description": "optional free text",
  "ids": ["optional", "one", "string", "per", "row"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | int | Must equal 1. Unknown versions are rejected, never guessed at. |
| `dims` | int | > 0. Logical dimensions per vector. |
| `count` | int | >= 0. Number of vectors. |
| `metric` | string | `"dot"`, `"cosine"`, or `"l2"` — the metric the bank is intended for. |
| `dtype` | string | `"float32"` (the interchange payload is always float32; quantization happens at bake). |
| `ids` | string[] | Optional. Exactly `count` entries, all unique. Absent means IDs are row indices. |

### `<name>.wvbank.bin` — the payload

Raw little-endian float32, row-major, exactly `count * dims * 4` bytes. No header, no
padding, no compression.

### Validation rules (importer obligations)

An importer must reject, with a specific diagnostic and no partial output:
payload size disagreeing with the header; any non-finite value; duplicate or
wrongly-counted ids; a zero-norm row when `metric` is `cosine`; unknown
`schemaVersion`, `metric`, or `dtype`.

## 2. Baked layout: what the kernels scan

Baking transforms interchange float32 into the scan-ready form. The library provides
every step (`bake.h`): `ValidateSourceRows` → `NormalizeRows` (Cosine only) →
`PadRowsFloat32` or `QuantizeRowsInt8`.

### Row storage

- Rows are stored row-major with a stride of `PaddedDims(dims, quantization)` elements:
  `dims` rounded up so the row stride is a multiple of **16 bytes** (4 floats, or
  16 int8s). Pad lanes are **zero** — this is a content rule, not a suggestion;
  `ValidateBankData` rejects violations (a non-zero pad lane silently corrupts L2).
- The base pointer of the row block must be **16-byte aligned**.

### Quantization (`Int8`)

Symmetric, per-row: `scale = maxAbs / 127`, `q[i] = round(v[i] / scale)` clamped to
[-127, 127]; dequantized value is `q[i] * scale`. A zero row stores `scale = 0` with
all-zero lanes. Scales must be finite and non-negative. Typical quality: recall@10
≈ 0.99 vs the float32 source on real embedding data — measure per bank (the reference
UE importer records a seeded recall report on every asset).

### Cosine banks are pre-normalized

`metric = cosine` banks store L2-normalized rows, so query-time scoring is a plain dot
product. Consequences: zero-norm *rows* are a bake-time error; zero-norm *queries*
are a query-validation error; there is no runtime normalization branch.

### Queries

A query is float32, padded to the bank's `paddedDims` with **zeros**, 16-byte aligned.
Non-finite values and non-zero pad lanes are validation errors — NaN never reaches a
kernel (a NaN score would break the ranking's total order).

### Scores

`dot`/`cosine`: higher is better. `l2`: the score is the **squared** L2 distance;
lower is better. Ties rank by ascending row index, always.

## 3. Forward compatibility

Consumers embedding this format in their own asset containers should reserve a
versioned, skippable block for future index structures (approximate-search
acceleration), so adding them later is additive rather than format-breaking. The
reference UE plugin does exactly this.
